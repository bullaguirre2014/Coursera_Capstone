This is the repository for the IBM Professional Certificate capstone project.

The main purpose of this project will be to analyze the vehicle collisions that have occurred within Seattle, Washington from 2004 - Present. Consequently, this dataset is updated on a weekly basis by and is provided by SPD and recorded by Traffic Records. As part of the analysis, we will be constructing a predictive model that will predict the severity of the collisions that have occurred within Seattle. In doing so, we will have a better understanding of what kind of factors lead to a higher amount of vehicle accidents.

The dataset that is used contains 194673 rows and 38 columns. Futhermore, it contains numerous features that may or may not directly pertain to the cause of the accident. Moreover, using these features will allow us to be able to predict the 'Severity Code' from these collisions to better undertand the magnitude, frequency of these occurrences, and what avenues may be taken to remedy the issue.
