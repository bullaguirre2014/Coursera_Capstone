# Coursera_Capstone
This is the repository for the IBM Professional Certificate capstone project.


The main purpose of this project will be to analyze the vehicle collisions that have occured within Seattle, Washington from 2004 - Present. As part of the analysis, I will be constructing a predictive model that will predict the severity of the collisions that have occured within Seattle. In doing so, we will have a better understanding of what kind of factors lead to a higher amount of vehicle accidents.
